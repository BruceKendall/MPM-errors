# Classifications

## Stage for age substitutions
The first step is to identify the populations that have a value of "Yes" for `MatrixCriteriaOntogeny`. Then we need to go to the papers to see what the assumptions are about stage duration and how the maturation rate was calculated.

## Maturation rate calculation
This will require a look at the sources.

## Appropriate reproduction by maturing individuals
For models with a post-breeding census, we need to examine whether individuals reaching the age of first reproduction are allowed to breed---typically this requires a value of F for the pre-reproductive stage. This will require inspection of sources for those models with a post-breeding census.

## Census type
For animals, it is often possible to distinguish between pre- and post-breeding census models by looking at the name of the first stage class. Basically, a first class that seems to be within a few days/weeks/months of breeding would be considered a post-breeding census, and a first class that seems to be about a year old would be a pre-breeding census. I classified as many as I could be certain of, in `first.state.xlsx`. Many others will still need a trip to the sources to be sure (e.g., what do the authors mean by "juvenile?").

For plants, this will be rather more challenging, and will probably require close inspection of individual sources. A protocol will be developed after examining some sources.

## Survival in F matrix
This will require a look at the sources, to determine whether survival was included in the F term, and if so, whether it was for parent or offspring.
